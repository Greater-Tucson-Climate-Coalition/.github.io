            <h1>The Arizona Corporation Commission</h1>
            <p>They set your electric rates, vote for three this November!</p>
            
            <h2>What does the Arizona Corporation Commission do? Why should I care?</h2>
            <p>The ACC  sets the utility rates that you pay for electricity, gas, water and waste.  Companies petition the ACC to approve rates they want for their products.  The ACC can accept, reject or modify proposed rates by balancing a "fair rate of return” for the Utilities against the needs of ratepayers. </p>
            
            <h2>What does this “fair rate of return” really mean?</h2>
            <p>Ratepayers (people who pay monthly bills and get electricity, water, gas, oil or waste services) are required to reimburse the Utilities for their operating expenses---plus an additional 9.55% to 9.9% on top of that.  That’s how your utility rates are determined. The more the Utilities spend within the ACC definitions of “operating expenses" the more the Utilities profit.  Investor owned utilities are legally required to maximize profits.  Only the ACC has the power to lower proposed rates.</p>
            
            <h2>What is the Arizona Corporation Commission (ACC)?</h2>
            <p>It is a government agency created in 1912 and granted power by Section XV of the Arizona Constitution.  Currently there are 5 Commissioners elected to  4 year terms.  The ACC is responsible for “establishing just and reasonable rates and charges to be made and collected, by public service corporations within the state for service rendered therein, and make reasonable rules, regulations, and orders, by which such corporations shall be governed in the transaction of business within the state….”</p>
            <p>Currently there are 4 Republican Commissioners and 1 Democrat.  In the upcoming November 6th general election 2 Republican Commissioners are running for re-election.  The 1 Democrat incumbent is not running for re-election.  So 3 of the 5 Commission seats are open to a public vote.</p>
            <p>A “public service corporation” includes investor owned utilities providing public services—like delivering electricity, gas, oil, water or waste disposal.</p>
